# Dashboard_pandas
A sample dashboard of world population growth and prosperity using pandas library
Creating an interactive dashbaord by Python is not as usual as creating visualization by Power Bi or Tableau or etc. Quite a few different visualization which can be created by python make python more intersting. In this repository it was tried to analyze the world population vs prosperity dataset, provided by: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/population-density-vs-prosperity, and at the end, to creat an interactive dashobard containing illustartions. The interaction between the dataset and the dashoabord was made through another Python's library-that is-"Panel."
